= Introduction =

Domlib is a Dominion card game engine with AI exports for decision making tasks. The goal is to allow the engine to iterate over a set of games to create a competitive environment for custom AIs. The goal is to keep the AI exports simple and let the engine do all the game validation, phase execution, and card tasks.
