#summary Activities and TODO items

= Activities & TODO Items =

== Large Items ==

 # Action cards need implementing.
 # Phases not completely ironed out.
 # Fix destructors not deleting child objects
 # AI hooks will need refining in light of action cards
 # Need to determine winners and the best reporting mechanism ( CSV, xml, etc )
 # Need to decide about engine versus AI error handling
 # Determine when/how to make a major release
 # Add correct licensing to each file.

== Long Term Brainstorm ==

 # Have the engine profile AI to determine their "style". Useful for data reporting
 # Load AIs via DLL at the command line.
  # May make it easier to share AIs for competitive purposes.
  # May make it easier to iterate over combination of AIs via command line.
  # Requires a "versioning" of the engine.
