# Activities & TODO Items #

## Large Items ##

  1. Action cards need implementing.

  1. Determine when/how to make a major release
  1. Add correct licensing to each file.

## Long Term Brainstorm ##

  1. Have the engine profile AI to determine their "style". Useful for data reporting
  1. Load AIs via DLL at the command line.
    1. May make it easier to share AIs for competitive purposes.
    1. May make it easier to iterate over combination of AIs via command line.
    1. Requires a "versioning" of the engine.
